Track the germs not the person

A germ has a unique id, can have a timestamp and location.

You can leave germs, you can spot germs or record your movements.

In the event of sickness, you can review your germs and publish the ones that might have transmitted the disease. 
So other persons can check whether they were in contact with those germs and act.
